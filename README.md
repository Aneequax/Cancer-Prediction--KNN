# Cancer-Prediction--KNN
This Project involves the Breast cancer prediction using KNN algorithm 

### Objective:
The repository is a learning exercise to:
* Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset
* Evaluate and interpret my results and justify my interpretation based on observed data set

The analysis is divided into four sections

1. Data Sources and data cleaning 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Pre-Processing the Data
4. Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is malignant or Benign

### DESCRIPTION:
This project focuses on developing a cancer prediction model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a popular machine learning technique. The aim is to classify whether a given set of medical data points to a diagnosis of cancer or not. The project involves gathering relevant medical data, pre-processing it for analysis, and training the KNN model to recognize patterns indicative of cancer. By leveraging the KNN algorithm, the model can make accurate predictions and potentially assist medical professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning. The ultimate goal is to improve healthcare outcomes through reliable, machine learning-driven predictions.

### PART 1 - Data Sources and data cleaning 


Data cleaning refers to the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in a dataset to improve its quality and reliability for analysis. It involves several steps, including removing or correcting inaccurate data, handling missing values, standardizing formats. 

### PART 2 -  Exploratory Data Analysis

I am getting familiar with the data using data exploration and visualization techniques using python libraries (Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn. Familiarity with the data is important which will provide useful knowledge for data pre-processing)

### PART 3- Pre-Processing the data

Find the most predictive features of the data and filter it so it will enhance the predictive power of the analytics model. In this part I have used feature selection to reduce high-dimension data, feature extraction and transformation for dimensionality reduction. This is essential in preparing the data before predictive models are developed.

### PART 4 - Predictive model

In this I have evaluated the model using confusion matrix , which is essential in assessing and interpreting the fitted model.
